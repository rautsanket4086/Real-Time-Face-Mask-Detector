# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector
Objective is to create a Real-Time Face Mask Detector which can solve monitoring issues in crowded areas such as Airports, Metros, etc. using CNN and OpenCV.
# Problem Statement

India has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic since 30 January 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 was reported. With the Unlock 4.0 phase set to begin in September, the need to be proactive is now more than ever. The objective is to create a Real-Time Face Mask Detector which can solve monitoring issues in crowded areas such as Airports, Metros, etc. using CNN and OpenCV.
# Dataset Description
The dataset is an artificial set of face mask images
• Total Images: 1376
• with_mask images:
• without_mask images:
The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not
